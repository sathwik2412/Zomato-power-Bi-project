 # Zomato Sales & User Analytics Dashboard
# Project Title:
## Zomato Business Intelligence Dashboard in Power BI

 # Objective:
The main goal of this project is to design a data-driven, visually engaging dashboard for Zomato, a leading food delivery platform.
The dashboard focuses on analyzing sales performance, user behavior, and city-level operations to provide actionable insights that can help drive business decisions and optimize strategies. It offers key visualizations on:
-  Total Sales Volume and Revenue
- User Engagement and Performance Metrics
- City-wise Sales, Ratings, and Customer Gains/Losses

By leveraging Power BI as a business intelligence tool, we aim to transform raw data into interactive insights that highlight trends, identify growth opportunities, and pinpoint areas of concern. We employed DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures, overcoming various data manipulation challenges along the way.

## Key Features:
### 1. Sales Overview
- Total Sales Amount: 987M
- Total Sales Quantity: 2M
- Ratings: 148K
- Total Orders: 150K
  
The dashboard breaks down sales data by various metrics, such as categories like Veg, Non-Veg, and Others, allowing for deeper analysis of product performance.

### 2. User Performance
- Active Users: 78K
- Total Users Count: 100K
- Ratings: 148K
- Total Orders: 150K

Detailed user metrics, including Gain and Lost Customers and User Age Distribution, provide insights into user behavior and platform engagement.

### 3. City Performance
- City-wise Sales Data: Provides insights into the sales value, gain, and loss of customers for top-performing cities like Electronic City, Baner-Pune, and others.
- Rating Count by City: Highlights how different cities rate their experience.
- Active Users by City: Displays which regions have the highest user engagement, assisting in location-based strategies.
## Technologies Used:
Power BI for data visualization, reporting, and interactive dashboards.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations, metrics, and advanced data modeling.
## DAX Challenges and Solutions:
Working with DAX posed several challenges, particularly when building custom columns for complex aggregations and calculations. For instance:
- Aggregating sales amounts across multiple data sources.
- Creating dynamic measures to capture customer churn and city-wise performance.
- Optimizing the DAX functions for performance to handle large datasets efficiently.

Through experimentation and troubleshooting, we were able to resolve issues related to slow query performance and data inconsistencies, eventually ensuring the dashboard runs smoothly with accurate and timely data.

## Conclusion:
This Power BI project offers a holistic view of Zomato's operations by integrating sales, user behavior, and city-specific performance into a single dashboard. The insights derived from this dashboard provide Zomato's decision-makers with the ability to:

- Track sales trends over time.
- Monitor user satisfaction and engagement metrics.
- Make informed decisions on city-based operations to improve services and customer retention.
  
The combination of powerful data visualization tools and DAX-driven calculations turns raw data into a strategic asset, helping Zomato optimize its performance in an increasingly competitive market.
